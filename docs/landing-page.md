## What This Course is About

This course teaches the maintenance and administration of Linux servers in both an on-premises and cloud based environment using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Students will learn to install, configure, test and maintain services commonly used by enterprises in a cloud environment. This course is the second in a series of courses about Linux technologies.

- OSL645 taught you to be a Linux user. **In OSL745, you will move from being a Linux user to being a Linux system administrator.**
- As a system administrator, you will be responsible for installing, configuring, adjusting, maintaining, and troubleshooting the operation of computer systems. This is a lot of responsibility, and with that responsibility comes power. You will be able to change anything on the system, and you will also have the ability to damage or destroy the system.
- In this course you will use an external SSD drive (USB 3) with the lab computers on campus to set up a Linux system.
- Alternatively you can use your own computer to complete the labs providing it meets the hardware requirements.
- You will also set up two additional Linux systems using Virtual Machines and KVM (Linux native virtualization), and therefore gain experience with different types of system configurations as well as setting up networking between systems.
- You will learn how to configure networking and security features both on-premises and in the cloud.

OSL745 will teach you to administer and use cloud-based services for DNS, Web server and databases.
In this course you will use AWS via the AWS learner lab. The AWS Learner Lab provides a sandbox environment where you can build, configure and deploy AWS assets such as instances. There are some limitations as to what you can do, however it provides all the functionality we require for this course. You are limited to $50 credit at no cost within the learner lab. Once this runs out, your account will be disabled. Additionally, there is no way to add funds to this pool. If you follow the lab instructions properly you should not have any issues.

## Learning by Doing

Most of the learning in this course occurs through the hands-on problem solving that takes place in the ten labs and two assignments.
